    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pavlova reminds us of backyard BBQ’s spent with friends under the summer sun. Just like custard trifle and ice cream pudding, it’s a beloved dish at Christmas time in Australia. Especially good after a heavy roast lunch, it’s the perfect light and fluffy dessert that leaves you feeling light and not sick from an overabundance of sugar.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div class="div2">
    <ul>
        <li>4 large egg whites</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup seasonal fruits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 9-inch circle on the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add in the sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat until thick and glossy. Gently fold in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and cornstarch.</li>
        <li>Spoon mixture inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper. Working from the center, spread mixture toward the outside edge, building edge slightly</li>

        <li>In a small bowl, beat heavy cream until stiff peaks form; set aside. Remove the paper, and place meringue on a flat serving plate. Fill the center of the meringue with whipped cream, and top with seasonal fruits. </li>
